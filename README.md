=====

Lightweight Flickr API for web only. Flickstein.NET was previoudsly named as Flickrizer.

### How to use?
Install in your project with NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/flickstein/


#### I need to work with .NET 2.0, Windows Phone or Flick's Blog, what can I do?
Flickstein.NET was just made to work with Flickr's Photos (with upload), Photosets, Galleries and People operations, using oAuth authentication for web apps. So, if you'll just work with these operations, Flickstein.NET is perfect! However, if you need to work with Windows Phone, Mono, .NET Framework below 3.5, or some Flickr's operation outside photos enviroment, check Flickr.NET project: http://flickrnet.codeplex.com/
