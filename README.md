### When to use Flickstein.NET and not Flickr.NET (http://flickrnet.codeplex.com/)?
Flickstein.NET is a lightweight library, just made to work with Flickr's Photos (with upload), Photosets, Galleries and People operations, using oAuth authentication for web apps. So, if you'll just work with these operations, it's much better to work with Flickstein.NET. Flickstein is, and always we'll be a lightweight library with only these features, I don't want to compete with Flickr.NET at all.


### When to use Flickr.NET (http://flickrnet.codeplex.com/) and not Flickstein.NET?
Flickr.NET is more in-depth (therefore more complex to use), have more Flickr operations, works with .NET 2.0 (Flickstein.NET is 3.5), has support for Windows Phone, Silverlight, etc...

### Some feature that you'd like to use and Flickstein.NET doesn't support?
