When use Flickstein.NET and not Flickr.NET (http://flickrnet.codeplex.com/)?
=====
Flickstein is a lightweight library, just made to work with Flickr's Photos (with upload), Photosets, Galleries and People operations, using oAuth authentication for web apps. So it's much more simpler than Flickr.NET if you'll just work with these operations. Supports .NET 3.5 and above.

When use Flickr.NET and not Flickstein.NET?
=====
Flickr.NET is more in-depth (therefore more complex to use), have more Flickr operations, works with .NET 2.0, has libraries for Windows Phone, Silverlight, etc...

Some feature that you'd like to use and Flickstein.NET doesn't support?
